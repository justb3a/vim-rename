vim-rename
==========

A command and function that basically does a ``:saveas <newfile>`` then removes the old filename on the disk.

This is a copy of **Christian Robinson's Rename vim plugin** because I could not find any other git repo for it.
Please go to http://christianrobinson.name/vim/ for further details. 

## Usage:

```
:Rename[!] {newname}
```
